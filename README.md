# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my completed REACT portfolio. Instead of using html and css like we used to, I was challenged to implement REACT to make my portfolio completely responsive. It was definitely a challenge, but I came out of it knowing how to better my portfolio. It is a very straightforward, but clean, website.
